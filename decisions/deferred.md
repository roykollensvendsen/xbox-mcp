# What is deliberately not done yet

A thing left undone with no trigger is a thing forgotten. Each row names what
would make it worth doing, so the question comes back on its own rather than
depending on someone remembering it. Nothing enforces a trigger; the list is
read whenever a decision record is written and when a phase ends.

| Not done | The trigger | Why not now |
|---|---|---|
| A coverage threshold in CI | Two months of measured coverage to set it below | A number picked before there is data is a guess with a gate on it |
| A code of conduct and issue templates | A second contributor, or the first outside issue | Boilerplate answering questions nobody has asked |
| A release workflow and publishing | The first release someone outside will install | A published name is claimed and a published version cannot be reused |
| `CODEOWNERS` | A second person who reviews | It would name one person as the owner of everything |
| `pre-commit` as a requirement rather than an option | A second contributor | The gates run in CI, and a hook one person installs is a hook one person maintains |
| Local SmartGlass (UDP on the home network) as well as the cloud | A test on this console shows it still answers locally, or the cloud route is withdrawn | Its library was archived in 2021 and was documented for the Xbox One; nothing shows a Series console answers it (ADR-XB-001) |
| Our own Azure app registration for the Microsoft sign-in | Microsoft stops accepting the library's public client id | It needs an Azure directory, whose sign-up may ask for a payment card, which is the owner's decision (ADR-XB-001) |
